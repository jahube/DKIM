* when disabled onmicrosoft default DKIM is used

Use DKIM to validate outbound email sent from your custom domain article:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/use-dkim-to-validate-outbound-email

"If you do not enable DKIM, Microsoft 365 automatically creates a 
1024-bit DKIM public key for your default domain and the associated 
private key which we store internally in our datacenter. 
By default, Microsoft 365 uses a default signing configuration for 
domains that do not have a policy in place.
This means that if you do not set up DKIM yourself, Microsoft 365 will 
use its default policy and keys it creates to enable DKIM for your domain."
